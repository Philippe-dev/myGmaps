# Google Maps

A plugin to add custom Google Maps in Dotclear blogs

This extension allows you to insert Google Maps in your blog. It creates a new entry type named map elements. These elements may be points, polylines, polygons, rectangles, circles, GeoRSS feeds or kml layers. You may then attach a map to any post or include it anywhere in your blog with a template tag, and display in the map any number of these elements.
